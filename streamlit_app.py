This is a Python script for deployment on Streamlit.

The Streamlit app is intended to digitise the classic pendulum experiment we perform in secondary school, particularly for the data tabulation and analysis aspects.

The content for the pendulum experiment is standard. Here, I have adapted it from Physics Matters Practical Book (3rd ed.) by Charles Chew and Ho Boon Tiong.
