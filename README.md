# Pendulum Experiment

This script is intended to be published as as Streamlit app at https://share.streamlit.io/tanjlg/pendulum/main.

The app is meant to be used as a digitised form of the Pendulum experiment typically conducted for Secondary 3 students, with no change to the data collection aspect - physically. However, the data tabulation will be digital, which will facilitate post-processing and data analysis. Crucially, students will be able to manipulate the widget to draw a line of best-fit between the period of the pendulum squared, and its length.
